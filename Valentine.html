  <h1>In the shadow of uncertainty, I quietly stand,
    As you weigh your options with a careful hand.
    Though hope flickers, a dim and distant light,
    I fear my chances pale in comparison's sight.</h1>

    <h1></h1>
    
    <h1>You, the object of my affection, so close yet far,
    from choosing , like a distant star.
    I watch as you ponder, with thoughtful grace,
    But in my heart, I feel I've lost the race.</h1>

    <h1></h1>

   <h1>Many friends by my side, but in this game of love,
    I wonder if I fit, if I'm worthy of.</h1>

    <h1></h1>

    <h1>Yet still, I'll hold onto hope, however slim,
    That you might see me, beyond the surface's whim.
    For though I doubt, I'll keep my heart open wide,
    Hoping against hope, you'll choose me as your guide.</h1>

    <h1></h1>

    <h1>But if not, I'll cherish the moments we've shared,
    And in friendship's embrace, I'll find solace and care.
    For love is not always about being chosen,
    But about the bonds we forge, our hearts unbroken.</h1>
